Prompt: Build a model, taking into account genomic data from a potential patient, age, gender, and other relevant factors like environmental factors,  Mutation in genes like BRCA1 can cause a greater risk for breast cancer development. 

●	Developed a classifier tool to predict breast cancer risk using genomic data and susceptibility to environmental factors that can be used as pre-screening survey to gauge patient’s risk level
●	Tested logistic regression machine learning algorithm using Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn packages to demonstrate how data collected from survey could be used to train model and predict patient’s risk level – model had 77% accuracy level
